Open files in Vim or Emacs quickly with fuzzy expressions and a live-updating
UI, even for directory-trees containing hundreds of thousands of files.

Fuzzy? When you enter "rwh", quickopen finds files like
       RenderWidgetHost
       render-widget-host
       threaded_window_handler

The results are ranked by relevance. In 10s of milliseconds. So you get new results
as you type. Thus, you might refine 'rwh' to 'rwhcpp' to get
render_widget_host.cpp

Key features:
- Blazingly fast! 15ms search time on full 180k-file Chrome directory tree.
- Integration with vim gf and emacs ff-find-other-file when they get stuck
- Index maintained in-memory, persists across editor sessions/instances
- Reasonablly pretty GUI, with fallback to curses in terminal sessions
- Same backend shared between emacs and vim

Coming soon:
- Searches influenced by open/current buffers


Dependencies
================================================================================
Linux:
        python-gtk2

OSX:
        http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#stable
        wxPython 2.8-osx-unicode-2.6

Setting up the quickopen daemon
================================================================================
 0. Tell quickopen to index some directories...
      nduca: ~/quickopen $ ./quickopen add ~/chromium
      nduca: ~/quickopen $ ./quickopen add ~/quickopen
      nduca: ~/quickopen $ ./quickopen ignore \*LayoutTests\*

 1. Check quickopen's status:
      nduca: ~/quickopen $ ./quickopen rawsearch foo
      Database is not fully indexed. Wait a bit or try quickopen status

      nduca: ~/quickopen $ ./quickopen status
      Syncing: 17802 files found, 116 dirs pending

      nduca: ~/quickopen $ ./quickopen status
      up-to-date: 158553 files indexed; 2-threaded searches

VIM Setup
================================================================================

Using pathogen:
1. http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
2. git submodule add https://github.com/natduca/quickopen ~/.vim/bundle/quickopen

By hand:
1. source quickopen/plugin/quickopen.vim

Emacs Setup
================================================================================

By hand:
  (load quickopen/elisp/quickopen.el)

Using site-lisp:
  git clone https://github.com/natduca/quickopen.git ~/.emacs/site-lisp

And if site-lisp isn't set up yet:
  (let ((site-lisp-dir (expand-file-name "~/.emacs/site-lisp")))
    (when (file-exists-p site-lisp-dir)
      (let ((default-directory site-lisp-dir))
        (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path '("."))
        (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path))))

Consider setting up binding ff-find-other-file to a hotkey if you haven't done
so already. Quickopen will be used if the basic ff-find-other-file produces no
results:
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-o") (lambda ()
                                (interactive "")
                                (ff-find-other-file)
                                ))
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-O") (lambda ()
                                (interactive "")
                                (ff-find-other-file t)
                                ))

Visual SlickEdit Setup
================================================================================

 1. Edit slickedit/QuickOpen.e
   You will need to provide the path to the quickopen directory.

 2. Exid slickedit/start_quickopen.sh
   This script is run when Visual SlickEdit is launched, you can add lines to
   this file to get quickopen to index or ignore particular directories. See
   the 'Setting up the quickopen daemon' section above for tips.

 2. Load the quickopen macro module by doing the following
    Macro > Load Module...

 3. Now set up a key binding for quick open.
    a) Click, Tools > Options...
    b) Expand 'Keyboard and Mouse'
    c) Select 'Key Bindings'
    d) Type QuickOpen in the 'Search by command:' text box. If all geos well,
       this command will exist and be found.
    e) Then click the 'Add..' button and bind to whichever keys you please,
       but I strongly recommend ctrl+shift+o for consistency with vi.

Once you've followed these steps, you should find that the quickopen daemon
starts when Visual SlickEdit launches and is ready when you use the key binding
you've set earlier.

Usage
================================================================================

  1. VIM:              C-O                   (ctrl-shift-o)  to open
                       gf   c-w                              to goto file

     Emacs:            M-S-o                 (meta-shift-o)  to open
                       C-Q                                   to open

     Visual SlickEdit: C-O                   (ctrl-shift-o)  to open

  2. Command line
      nduca: ~/quickopen $ ./quickopen
         <brings up a GUI for a picking a file,
          prints file picked to stdout once done>
